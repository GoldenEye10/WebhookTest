# Xola Webhook Handler
This application is designed to process incoming webhook data from Xola, a platform for managing bookings and payments. It receives JSON data from Xola's webhook endpoint, processes the booking details, and stores the relevant data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- Handles Xola webhook data for both **professional learning** and **youth experience** events, Ignores **Any Other bookings like Individual Bookings** events.
- Extracts and processes all necessay details in JSON like experiences, demographics, quantity, notes, name, email, date, themes, locations etc.
- Integrates with a PostgreSQL database to store processed data for further use.
- Provides logic for handling different events and order statuses(Integer such as `order.update`, `order.cancel` and Integer status of order.

---
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the server
- **PostgreSQL** for database storage
- **Body-Parser** for parsing incoming webhook payloads
- **Xola Webhook ** to receive booking and event updates

---
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- npm (Node Package Manager)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoldenEye10/XolaWebhookHandler.git
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder

Once youâ€™ve cloned the repository, change to the project directory:
cd XolaWebhookHandler

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm intall pg
```

#### Step 4: Set Up PostgreSQL Database Connection

Create a .env file in the root of the project and define your PostgreSQL database connection parameters:

```bash
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_PORT=5432

PORT= ....(8000 or any port you want it to run)
```

#### Step 5: Start the Application

Run the following command to start the application:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will listen for incoming webhooks on port specified in PORT of .env file

## How It Works
1. **Webhook Endpoint**:
    - Listens on `/webhook`.
    - Parses incoming payload and identifies the type of experience (professional or youth).

2. **Professional Learning**:
    - Collects relevant details like themes, locations, and programs.
    - Inserts data into corresponding database tables.
    - Calls various helper functions (e.g., `Invoice`, `getThemes`, etc.) for processing.

3. **Youth Experience**:
    - Similar to professional learning but uses different workflows to handle school-related data.

4. **Duplicate Prevention**:
    - Tracks processed event IDs in memory to avoid reprocessing.

5. **Database Transaction**:
    - Ensures atomicity for each webhook event using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`.

---

## Database Interaction
This application interacts with multiple database tables:

- **Invoices**: Stores invoice details.
- **Themes**: Associates the booking with specific themes.
- **Locations**: Tracks booking locations.
- **Programs**: Maps programs to bookings.
- **Contacts**: Saves customer contact details.
- **ProfessionalLearningClasses**: Stores data for professional learning classes.
- **YouthExperienceClasses**: Stores data for youth experience bookings.

> **Note**: Ensure the database schema matches the expected structure.

## Error Handling

The application implements robust error handling to ensure stability:

1. **Invalid Payloads:**
       - Logs the issue and responds with a 400 Bad Request.
2. **Database Errors:**
      -  Rolls back incomplete transactions and responds with a 500 Internal Server Error.
3. **Duplicate Events:**
       - Prevents reprocessing by tracking event IDs in memory.

---
## API Responses
The webhook endpoint provides clear responses to indicate the processing status:

   - 200 OK: The webhook is successfully processed or skipped (duplicate detection).
   - 400 Bad Request: The incoming payload is invalid or malformed.
   - 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred during processing.

---
## Customization Options
You can customize the following aspects of the application:

- Logging and Debugging:

    Adjust console.log statements or implement a logging library for more advanced tracking.
---

## Testing
You can test the webhook endpoint using a CPAWS Sandbox:

**NOTE**
The instance of this code should be already hosted on digital ocean, so if testing on any other server and interacting with CPAWS database, you will need to stop the cloud instance from running:


Testing on VSCODE:
Webhook can be only sent to publicly accessible url endpoint, so if we want to run in vscode, we have to do Tunneling using NGROK

## Step 1: SET UP NGROK
   
A) REGISTRATION
1. Visit the Ngrok Website

    Go to the Ngrok website. https://ngrok.com/
    Click the "Sign Up" button at the top right corner of the homepage.

2. Create an Account

    Choose how you'd like to register:
        With an Email Address:
            Enter your name, email address, and password.
            Click Sign Up.
        With a GitHub or Google Account:
            Click the respective button (GitHub or Google).
            Authorize Ngrok to access your account.
    Check your email inbox (if you signed up via email) for a verification link and click it to verify your account.

3. Log In

    Once your account is created, log in to the Ngrok Dashboard using your credentials.

4. Get Your Authtoken

    After logging in, go to the "Get Started" section on the dashboard.
    Copy your Authtoken, which will look something like:
    2A9g54YZABz7KnXXXOg85h32WzP_3MdXXXX

After creating account you have to follow following steps:

5. Download and Install Ngrok
  -  Go to the Ngrok download page.
  - Download the version for your operating system.
  - Install it:

    - macOS/Linux: Unzip the file and move the ngrok binary to a directory in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin).
    -  Windows: Unzip the file and place it in a directory. Optionally, add the directory to your PATH.

6. Authenticate Ngrok

  -  Open your terminal.
  -  Authenticate with your Ngrok account using the authtoken provided in your dashboard:
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken <your-authtoken>
    ```
    
    

    Replace <your-authtoken> with the token from your Ngrok dashboard.

7.  Start Your Local Server

Ensure your local application is running on port 3004. For example:
```bash
node app.js
```

8.  Expose Localhost with Ngrok

Run the following command to expose your server:

```bash
ngrok http 3004

```

9. Use the Public URL

Ngrok will display output like this:

```bash
Forwarding                    https://3e7d-206-123-191-9.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3004  
```

With this setup whenever xola send webhook to this ngrok url, it will forward it to your local host at port 3004

https one is the public url on which we have to subscribe xola webhook


## Step 2: Subscribe to webhook
   
Access subscribe page in xola website: https://developers.xola.com/reference/subscribe

Fill up the blank spaces in body params, metadata and header

Step 1: 
In eventName you put in kind of webhook you want
- Order.create
- Order.update
- Order.cancel

Step 2:
In url: put in the endpoint url from above + /webhook ( url/webhook)
For example: if hosted website give url https://3e7d-206-123-191-9.ngrok-free.app
Put https://3e7d-206-123-191-9.ngrok-free.app/webhook in url

Step 3:
Apiversion: 2020-10-14

Step 4: METADATA:
User id: you put in the seller id

Step 5: API- key of app 
In top right header, you put in the api key

Once you have all this, click on try it, it will give you response status of 201 and it will subscribe to webhook.
