# Xola Webhook Handler
This application is designed to process incoming webhook data from Xola, a platform for managing bookings and payments. It receives JSON data from Xola's webhook endpoint, processes the booking details, and stores the relevant data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- Handles Xola webhook data for both **professional learning** and **youth experience** events.
- Extracts and processes all necessay details in JSON like experiences, demographics, quantity, notes, name, email, date and add-ons.
- Integrates with a PostgreSQL database to store processed data for further use.
- Provides logic for handling different events and order statuses(Integer such as `order.update`, `order.create` and status of order.

---
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the server
- **PostgreSQL** for database storage
- **Body-Parser** for parsing incoming webhook payloads
- **Xola Webhook ** to receive booking and event updates

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- npm (Node Package Manager)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoldenEye10/WebhookTest.git
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder

Once youâ€™ve cloned the repository, change to the project directory:
cd WebhookTest

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm intall pg
```

#### Step 4: Set Up PostgreSQL Database Connection

Create a .env file in the root of the project and define your PostgreSQL database connection parameters:

```bash
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_PORT=5432

PORT= ....(8000 or any port you want it to run)
```

#### Step 5: Start the Application

Run the following command to start the application:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will listen for incoming webhooks on port specified in PORT of .env file

## How It Works
1. **Webhook Endpoint**:
    - Listens on `/webhook`.
    - Parses incoming payload and identifies the type of experience (professional or youth).

2. **Professional Learning**:
    - Collects relevant details like themes, locations, and programs.
    - Inserts data into corresponding database tables.
    - Calls various helper functions (e.g., `Invoice`, `getThemes`, etc.) for processing.

3. **Youth Experience**:
    - Similar to professional learning but uses different workflows to handle school-related data.

4. **Duplicate Prevention**:
    - Tracks processed event IDs in memory to avoid reprocessing.

5. **Database Transaction**:
    - Ensures atomicity for each webhook event using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`.

## Database Interaction
This application interacts with multiple database tables:

- **Invoices**: Stores invoice details.
- **Themes**: Associates the booking with specific themes.
- **Locations**: Tracks booking locations.
- **Programs**: Maps programs to bookings.
- **Contacts**: Saves customer contact details.
- **ProfessionalLearningClasses**: Stores data for professional learning classes.
- **YouthExperienceClasses**: Stores data for youth experience bookings.

> **Note**: Ensure the database schema matches the expected structure.

## Error Handling

The application implements robust error handling to ensure stability:

1. **Invalid Payloads:**
       - Logs the issue and responds with a 400 Bad Request.
2. **Database Errors:**
      -  Rolls back incomplete transactions and responds with a 500 Internal Server Error.
3. **Duplicate Events:**
       - Prevents reprocessing by tracking event IDs in memory.

---
## API Responses
The webhook endpoint provides clear responses to indicate the processing status:

   - 200 OK: The webhook is successfully processed or skipped (duplicate detection).
   - 400 Bad Request: The incoming payload is invalid or malformed.
   - 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred during processing.

---
## Customization Options
You can customize the following aspects of the application:

- Specified Values:

    Modify the specifiedValues array to detect professional learning events based on your specific requirements.

- Logging and Debugging:

    Adjust console.log statements or implement a logging library for more advanced tracking.
---

## Testing
You can test the webhook endpoint using a tool like Postman or cURL:
Using Postman:

- Set the URL to http://localhost:8000/webhook.
- Select the POST method.
- Add a JSON payload in the request body.
- Set the Content-Type header to application/json.
- Send the request and verify the response.
